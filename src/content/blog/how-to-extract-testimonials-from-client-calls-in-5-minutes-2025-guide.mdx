## Why Client Calls Are Testimonial Gold Mines

Client calls capture authentic emotions that scripted testimonials can't match. **92% of consumers read testimonials before purchasing**, making these conversations your most valuable sales asset. [Source: BeMySocial]

**The authenticity advantage:** Raw, honest stories build more trust than polished content in 2025.

| Testimonial Source | Trust Level | Conversion Impact | Time to Extract |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Live Client Calls | Highest | 77% buy rate | 1-2 minutes |
| Post-Call Surveys | High | 34% lift | 1 minute |
| Scripted Videos | Medium | Standard rate | 15+ minutes |

### Why Timing Matters

**Key advantages of call extraction:**
- Captures genuine emotion and specific results
- No additional scheduling or coordination needed  
- Higher response rates when asked during positive moments
- Builds naturally into existing client conversations



## Step 1: Prepare Your Testimonial Questions (30 Seconds)

**Preparation prevents poor performance.** Have 2-3 targeted questions ready before every client call.

### The Before-During-After Framework

1. **Before Question:** "What was your biggest challenge before we started?"
2. **During Question:** "What surprised you most about the process?"  
3. **After Question:** "How has this changed your [specific outcome]?"

**Pro tip:** Write questions on sticky notes near your screen for easy reference.

**Best testimonial triggers:**
- "What was your biggest win from this?"
- "How would you describe the results to a friend?"
- "What would you tell someone considering this?"



## Step 2: Record Live Responses (1-2 Minutes)

**Strike while the iron is hot.** Ask testimonial questions immediately after clients share wins or express satisfaction.

### Recording Setup Checklist

- ✓ Enable call recording at the start (with permission)
- ✓ Use video when possible - 77% more convincing than audio
- ✓ Keep phone/backup recording as insurance
- ✓ Note timestamps for easy editing later

**The 2-minute rule:** Limit testimonial extraction to maximum 2 minutes per call. This keeps energy high and responses natural.

**What authentic looks like:** Imperfect, emotional responses outperform scripted ones. Don't ask clients to "start over" if they stumble.



## Step 3: Follow Up Immediately (1 Minute)

**Speed kills hesitation.** Send a follow-up survey within 5 minutes while emotions are fresh.

### Quick Survey Template

"Thanks for the great call! Could you answer one quick question to help others like you?"

**Survey options:**
- Email with 1-2 questions max
- Text message with simple rating + comment
- Video request through platforms like Trustmary

**Pros:**
- Captures additional details missed in calls
- Gives clients time to think and elaborate
- Creates written backup of verbal testimonials

**Cons:**
- Lower response rates than live extraction
- May lose emotional intensity from the moment



## Step 4: Edit and Deploy (2 Minutes)

**Keep it simple and fast.** Basic editing beats perfectionism every time.

### Quick Editing Process

1. **Extract the best 15-30 second clip** with specific results
2. **Add client name and company** as text overlay
3. **Include context** if needed ("After 3 months working together...")

**What to look for in clips:**
- Specific numbers or outcomes mentioned
- Emotional language ("game-changer," "couldn't believe")
- Clear before/after comparisons
- Industry-specific challenges overcome

**Deployment checklist:**
- ✓ Post to website testimonials page
- ✓ Share on LinkedIn with client tagged (with permission)
- ✓ Add to email signatures and proposals
- ✓ Include in sales presentations



## Common Mistakes That Kill Testimonial Quality

**Avoid these testimonial extraction killers** that reduce authenticity and response rates.

### The Big 4 Mistakes

**Mistake #1: Waiting too long to ask**
Ask during the emotional high, not days later when excitement fades.

**Mistake #2: Over-scripting responses**

**Mistake #3: Making it about you**
Focus on their results and transformation, not your process.

**Mistake #4: Asking for too much**
One great 30-second clip beats a 5-minute rambling testimonial.

**Red flags to avoid:**
- Asking during problem-solving calls
- Requesting multiple takes for "perfection"  
- Leading clients toward specific phrases
- Forgetting to get usage permissions



## Next Steps: Build Your Testimonial System

**Consistency beats perfection.** Build testimonial extraction into every client success conversation.

**Your 5-minute action plan:**
1. **Today:** Write your 3 go-to testimonial questions
2. **This week:** Practice on 2-3 client calls with recording
3. **This month:** Build a testimonial library with 10+ authentic clips
