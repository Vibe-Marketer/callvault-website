## Overview: Why Coaching Call SOPs Drive Results

Most managers waste their coaching sessions with generic advice. **29% of reps receive non-actionable feedback** that doesn't move the needle.

**The solution:** Transform your best coaching calls into repeatable SOPs that scale success across your entire team.

| Coaching Approach | Generic Advice | SOP-Based Coaching | AI-Enhanced SOPs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Best For | Quick check-ins | Systematic improvement | Scale + personalization |
| Performance Boost | Minimal | 25-40% improvement | Up to 50% boost |
| Time Investment | Low | Medium | High initial, low ongoing |
| ROI Potential | Limited | 962% average | 1000%+ potential |

### The Numbers Don't Lie

**Why SOPs from coaching calls work:**
- Turn one-time wins into repeatable processes
- Scale your best performers' techniques across the team
- Create consistent messaging and approach
- Reduce training time for new hires



## Step 1: Identify Your Golden Coaching Calls

Start with your winners. **Don't waste time analyzing mediocre performances.**

### How to Spot Golden Calls

1. **Revenue Impact:** Calls that directly led to closed deals or advanced opportunities
2. **Breakthrough Moments:** Sessions where struggling reps had "aha" moments
3. **Objection Mastery:** Calls where reps overcame difficult objections smoothly

**Your selection criteria:**
- Rep showed immediate improvement after the call
- Techniques were easily replicable by others
- Results were measurable (meetings booked, deals advanced)

### Pro Tip

**Focus on frequency over perfection.** As Mark Ackers notes: "Without a detailed understanding of each rep's challenges, coaching can become predictable and impersonal." [Source: MySalesCoach]

Review at least 3-5 high-performing coaching calls before creating your first SOP.



## Step 2: Extract Repeatable Patterns and Scripts

**This is where the magic happens.** Most managers listen to calls but never document what actually works.

### What to Document

**Conversation Flow:**
- Opening statements that build rapport
- Discovery question sequences
- Transition phrases between topics
- Closing techniques that actually get commitment

**Objection Handling Scripts:**
- Exact words that defuse common objections
- Stories and examples that resonate
- Reframing techniques that shift perspective

### Step-by-Step Extraction Process

1. **Listen with Purpose:** Focus on moments when the conversation shifted positively
2. **Transcribe Key Phrases:** Write down exact words that worked
3. **Map the Flow:** Document the sequence of successful interactions
4. **Test Repeatability:** Can another rep follow this exact process?

**Pro tip:** Use AI transcription tools to speed up this process. **56% of coaches now leverage AI** for call analysis and pattern recognition. [Source: EntrepreneursHQ]



## Step 3: Structure Your SOP Documentation

**Raw notes don't create results.** Your SOPs need clear structure that any team member can follow.

### Essential SOP Components

**Pros of Structured SOPs:**
- Easy to train new team members
- Consistent results across the team
- Clear success metrics to track

**Cons of Poor Documentation:**
- Knowledge stays trapped with individuals
- Inconsistent execution
- No way to measure improvement

### SOP Template Framework

- ✓ **Situation:** When to use this approach
- ✓ **Objective:** What you're trying to achieve
- ✓ **Script/Process:** Step-by-step actions
- ✓ **Success Metrics:** How to measure results
- ✓ **Common Pitfalls:** What to avoid

**Make it actionable:** Include specific examples, not just theory. As Federico Presicci emphasizes: "The key is moving from a reactive to a proactive coaching model." [Source: Federico Presicci]



## Step 4: Test and Refine Your SOPs

**Don't assume your first version is perfect.** Even the best coaching insights need refinement through real-world testing.

### Testing Protocol

1. **Pilot with Top Performers:** Have your best reps test the SOP first
2. **Measure Baseline:** Track current performance metrics before implementation
3. **Roll Out Gradually:** Introduce to 2-3 team members initially
4. **Gather Feedback:** Weekly check-ins during the first month

**Key metrics to track:**
- Deal advancement rates
- Objection handling success
- Meeting-to-opportunity conversion
- Time to close

### Refinement Indicators

**When to update your SOP:**
- Success rates below 70% after 30 days
- Consistent feedback about unclear steps
- Market conditions or buyer behavior changes
- New objections emerge frequently

Remember: **Companies providing ongoing training see a 50% boost in net sales per employee.** [Source: Sopro] Your SOPs should evolve with your team's needs.



## Step 5: Scale and Systematize Implementation

**This step separates good managers from great ones.** Creating SOPs is just the beginning - systematic implementation drives results.

### Implementation Strategy

**Your rollout plan:**
1. **Train the Trainers:** Ensure team leads master the SOPs first
2. **Create Practice Sessions:** Role-play scenarios using the documented processes
3. **Establish Review Cycles:** Weekly SOP performance check-ins
4. **Build Feedback Loops:** Continuous improvement based on results

**Technology integration:**
- Use CRM tags to track SOP usage
- Set up automated reminders for coaching sessions
- Create dashboards to monitor performance metrics

### Long-Term Success Framework

**Systematic approach beats sporadic efforts.** Research shows that **just under 30% of sales professionals receiving weekly coaching become top performers.** [Source: Sopro]

**Your sustainability checklist:**
- ✓ Monthly SOP review and updates
- ✓ New hire onboarding integration
- ✓ Performance tracking dashboards
- ✓ Recognition programs for SOP adoption
- ✓ Quarterly coaching call analysis for new SOPs



## Common Mistakes That Kill SOP Success

**Avoid these pitfalls that derail even the best intentions.** Most managers make these errors without realizing it.

### The Big Three Mistakes

**Mistake #1: Creating SOPs Without Call Review**
**29% of coaching sessions provide non-actionable feedback** because managers rely on assumptions instead of actual call analysis. [Source: MySalesCoach]

**Mistake #2: One-Size-Fits-All Approach**
Generic SOPs ignore individual rep strengths and challenges. Personalization is key to the **25-40% improvement** in deal sizes and win rates.

**Mistake #3: Set-and-Forget Mentality**
SOPs need regular updates. Market conditions change, buyer behavior evolves, and your team grows.

### Warning Signs Your SOPs Are Failing

- Adoption rates below 60% after 60 days
- No measurable improvement in key metrics
- Team members creating their own "workarounds"
- Coaching sessions still feel generic and repetitive

**The fix:** Return to your golden coaching calls regularly. **Increase the frequency of coaching sessions** for stronger performance improvements. [Source: Federico Presicci]
