faqSchema:
- question: 'Which is better for small teams: CallVault AI or tl;dv?'
  answer: tl;dv is better for small teams due to its unlimited free plan with video
    recordings and transcripts, making it accessible for budget-conscious organizations.
    The platform provides essential meeting intelligence features including AI-generated
    summaries, speaker identification, and CRM integrations without any upfront costs.
    CallVault AI targets enterprise clients with advanced security and compliance
    features that may be overkill for smaller organizations, requiring significant
    investment and dedicated IT resources that most small teams don't have available.
- question: Does tl;dv work with all video conferencing platforms?
  answer: Yes, tl;dv supports the three major video conferencing platforms including
    Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams through its intelligent bot-based recording
    system. The platform seamlessly joins meetings as a participant to capture high-quality
    video and audio. Additionally, tl;dv offers mobile auto-recording capabilities
    for both iOS and Android devices, enabling field teams and remote workers to
    record meetings from anywhere. This comprehensive platform support covers the
    vast majority of business video conferencing needs without requiring any special
    hardware or complex integrations.
- question: What makes CallVault AI different from tl;dv?
  answer: CallVault AI focuses on enterprise-grade call analytics, compliance monitoring,
    and advanced security features specifically designed for large-scale business
    communications across multiple channels. The platform emphasizes regulatory compliance,
    custom analytics, and deep integration with enterprise systems. In contrast,
    tl;dv specializes in accessible meeting recording and transcription for virtual
    conferences with strong multilingual support, targeting small to medium-sized
    teams with its generous free tier and user-friendly interface. While tl;dv democratizes
    meeting intelligence, CallVault AI provides comprehensive communication analytics
    for organizations with complex security and compliance requirements.
- question: Can I use tl;dv for free long-term?
  answer: Yes, tl;dv's free plan includes unlimited video recordings and AI-generated
    transcripts, making it viable for long-term use without any subscription costs.
    However, there's an important limitation to consider - video and transcript access
    is restricted to just 3 days after recording. This encourages teams to review
    and act on meeting content promptly rather than letting recordings accumulate.
    If your workflow requires extended storage for compliance, historical reference,
    or delayed review, you'll need to upgrade to one of tl;dv's paid plans which
    offer permanent storage, advanced AI features, and enhanced integration capabilities.
- question: Which tool offers better transcription accuracy?
  answer: tl;dv publicly claims over 90% transcription accuracy across 30+ languages,
    leveraging leading AI engines and advanced speech recognition technology. The
    platform's accuracy benefits from continuous improvements in natural language
    processing and speaker identification capabilities. CallVault AI's transcription
    accuracy likely depends on its enterprise-grade speech recognition technology
    and may offer customization for industry-specific terminology, though the company
    doesn't publish specific accuracy metrics publicly. For organizations where transcription
    precision is critical, both platforms likely offer ways to improve accuracy through
    custom vocabulary, but tl;dv's transparent metrics provide more confidence for
    initial evaluation.
