## Question 1: Does It Support Cloud Deployment and Scale for Your Team?

**Cloud-based solutions dominate the market for good reason.** They hold 61.20% market share in 2025 and are growing at 9.50% CAGR. [Source: SNS Insider]

Small and medium enterprises are the fastest-growing segment at 9.3% CAGR, making scalability crucial.

| Deployment Type | Market Share | Best For | Key Advantage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud-Based | 61.20% | Growing teams, remote work | Scalability, cost-effectiveness |
| On-Premise | 38.80% | High-security needs | Complete control, customization |
| Hybrid | Emerging | Large enterprises | Flexibility, gradual migration |

### Why Cloud Wins for Most Businesses

**Cost-effectiveness drives adoption.** You avoid massive upfront infrastructure investments and get automatic updates.

**Key scalability benefits:**
- Pay-as-you-grow pricing models
- Instant capacity increases during peak periods
- Automatic software updates and security patches
- Remote team accessibility from day one

**Red flag:** If a vendor can't clearly explain their cloud architecture or data redundancy, keep looking.



## Question 2: How Strong Are Its AI Analytics and Fraud Detection?

**AI isn't just a buzzword—it delivers measurable results.** Companies using AI-driven call recording report 20-25% improvement in customer satisfaction and support efficiency. [Source: SNS Insider]

Here's the reality: 50-60% of companies now use call recording specifically for fraud detection.

### Essential AI Features to Evaluate

1. **Real-time transcription:** Converts speech to text instantly for analysis
2. **Sentiment analysis:** Identifies customer emotions and satisfaction levels  
3. **Keyword spotting:** Flags compliance violations or sales opportunities
4. **Predictive insights:** Anticipates customer needs and agent coaching requirements

**What to test during demos:**
- Accuracy of transcription with your industry terminology
- Speed of real-time analysis and alerts
- Integration with your existing analytics tools
- Customizable triggers for your specific use cases

## Question 3: Is It Fully Compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and Regional Privacy Laws?

**Compliance isn't optional—it's your biggest risk factor.** North America leads the market with 41.12% share partly due to stringent regulatory requirements. [Source: Coherent Market Insights]

Data privacy concerns are actually limiting market adoption, making compliant vendors more valuable.

### Compliance Checklist

- ✓ GDPR compliance with explicit consent management
- ✓ CCPA alignment for California customer data
- ✓ End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest
- ✓ Transparent data handling and retention policies
- ✓ Right to deletion and data portability features
- ✓ Regular security audits and certifications

**Pros of choosing compliance-first vendors:**
- Reduced legal risk and potential fines
- Customer trust and competitive advantage
- Future-proofing against evolving regulations

**Cons of cutting corners:**
- Massive potential fines (up to 4% of annual revenue)
- Reputation damage and customer loss
- Expensive retrofitting of non-compliant systems

## Question 4: What CRM and VoIP Integrations Does It Offer?

**Integration capabilities make or break your ROI.** With remote work driving market growth, seamless connections between your call recording and existing tools are non-negotiable.

The best solutions integrate with popular CRM platforms and VoIP systems without requiring technical expertise.

**Essential integrations to verify:**
- Salesforce, HubSpot, and other major CRMs
- Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and video platforms
- Popular VoIP systems like RingCentral or 8x8
- Help desk software like Zendesk or Freshdesk
- Analytics platforms for comprehensive reporting

### Integration Benefits You Should Expect

**Automatic call logging:** No manual data entry required for your sales team.

**Contextual insights:** Customer history appears alongside call recordings for better service.

**Workflow automation:** Trigger follow-up tasks based on call content and outcomes.

**Pro tip:** Ask for a live demo showing real integrations, not just screenshots or promises.



## Question 5: What Are the Real Costs and Storage Security?

**Total cost of ownership goes far beyond the monthly subscription.** Enterprise licensing starts around $4,480+ annually, but hidden costs can double your budget. [Source: Archive Market Research]

Smart buyers evaluate the complete cost structure upfront.

### Cost Components to Calculate

1. **Base licensing fees:** Per-user or per-minute pricing models
2. **Storage costs:** Charges for call data retention beyond basic limits
3. **Compliance features:** Premium pricing for advanced security and reporting
4. **Integration fees:** Setup costs for CRM and VoIP connections
5. **Training and support:** Onboarding and ongoing assistance costs

**Storage security questions to ask:**
- Where is data stored geographically?
- What encryption standards are used?
- How long is data retained by default?
- What are the costs for extended retention?
- Can you export data if you switch vendors?

**Your cost evaluation checklist:**
- ✓ Get all-inclusive pricing for your expected usage
- ✓ Understand overage charges for storage and users
- ✓ Verify compliance feature costs aren't hidden extras
- ✓ Test the cancellation process and data export options
