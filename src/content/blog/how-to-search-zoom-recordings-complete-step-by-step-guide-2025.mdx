## Step 2: Organize and Search Local Recordings

Local recordings offer unlimited storage but require manual organization. This method works for all Zoom accounts, including free plans.

### Locate Your Local Recordings

1. **Open Zoom desktop app** and go to Settings

3. **Navigate to the folder** (default: Documents/Zoom)

**Default locations:**
- **Windows:** C:\Users\[Username]\Documents\Zoom
- **Mac:** /Users/[Username]/Documents/Zoom
- **Custom:** Check your Recording settings

### Optimize Local File Organization

**Best practices for searchable files:**
- Rename files with descriptive titles: "2025-01-15-TeamMeeting-BudgetReview.mp4"
- Create folder structures by project, date, or department
- Use consistent naming conventions across your team
- Add meeting topics to file properties/tags

**Pros:**
- Unlimited storage space

- ✓ Allow 1-3 hours for processing after meetings

### Advanced Search Techniques

**Keyword search examples:**

**Enterprise features:**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Even with Zoom's powerful search tools, users make critical errors that waste time. Here's what to avoid based on common user experiences.

**The biggest mistakes:**
- Waiting for instant transcription (processing takes hours)
- Ignoring file naming conventions for local recordings
- Not enabling cloud recording before important meetings
- Searching only by meeting titles instead of content

### Troubleshooting Search Issues

**If recordings don't appear:**
- Check if cloud recording was enabled during the meeting
- Verify your account has sufficient storage space
- Confirm transcription processing is complete
- Ensure you have proper sharing permissions

**Performance optimization tips:**
- Use specific keywords rather than broad terms
- Filter by date ranges to narrow results
- Bookmark frequently accessed recordings
- Export important transcripts as backup files
